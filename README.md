3 - How to run it!

When you first open the page, you will see several buttons at the top. There is a button to reset the page and get the full list of shows. 

The other buttons, each labeled for a particular genre, allow you to filter through the show list and only return a list of shows with your genre interest.  When you click on each show, you will see more information.  

This information includes the show name, genres, summary, show poster, and the show's official site. You are able to reset the show list by clicking the "reset show list" button.
